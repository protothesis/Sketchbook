## [Unreleased]

### Added

- 2026-10-04: Initial sketch created from the "Procedural Dungeon Engine —
  Prototype Design Doc" (copied to `DESIGN.md`).
- Engine (`engine/`): hash-chained seeds with fresh entropy, seeded per-space
  PRNG and derived streams, chamber/corridor/stub shape generators,
  spatial registry, `expand`/`commit`/`revert` with seeded placement
  fallbacks, caps, simple loop connections, and JSON export/import with
  exact replay.
- Prototype renderer (`app/`): pan/zoom canvas map, clickable doorways,
  ghosted candidate with Accept/Reroll, inspector, revert, caps, export/import,
  and debug toggles (grid, seed labels, registry occupancy, path to root).
  Expeditions autosave to `localStorage`.
- `stress-test.js`: headless checks for overlaps, registry rebuild, replay
  and cycles.
- 2026-10-19: Walk mode (`play.html`, `app/play.js`), a third-person 3D
  client built on three.js (vendored r160). You move with WASD or a touch
  stick. Pushing into a closed door (or pressing E) calls `expand` + `commit`
  with fresh entropy. The new space then appears outward from the door while
  the door swings open. It also has lantern lighting with black fog, a
  cutaway for walls south of the figure, per-space captions, and a minimap.
  It shares the map view's autosave. Design parameters are in `PLAY.md`.

### Fixed

- 2026-10-19: You can now move between views either way and start a new map
  from walk mode. Walk mode has **Chart view** and **New map** buttons (press
  New map twice to confirm, instead of `window.confirm()`, which some
  embedded viewers block). The chart view has a **Walk 3D** button on the
  map, and its header link is now readable on the dark theme.
